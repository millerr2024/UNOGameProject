# UNOGameProject
A basic UNO game written in Java focused on object-oriented programming and inheritance

This was the final project for my Data Structures class in Fall of 2020 at Carleton College. The requirements detailed that it must be an object-oriented project that uses classes and objects effectively. It should also use inheritance meaningfully. I moved it onto GitHub in November of 2021.

To play, first compile. Then, run Game.java.
